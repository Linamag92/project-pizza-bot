# Pizza Bot

The project this week was to create a little pizza bot with Javascript. 

## The problem
We learnt to: 
- Be comfortable using variables
- Know some string methods to modify strings
- Understand control flow and the use of conditionals statements
- Be able to write basic functions which take arguments and return values
- Connect the JavaScript to show visual feedback in the HTML

We worked in pair programming with @Leidstedt and @linamag92.

We struggled to set the functions and to make the connection with the HTML file.
